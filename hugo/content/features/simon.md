Simon Doty’s origins from deep in Canada’s Western wilderness to a college basketball shooting guard are unlikely beginnings for the development of a finely tuned electronic artist. This sound selector and creator is a self-taught gear master ‘whiz kid’ with a profound understanding of musical composition and engineering that has earned the ear of his peers and heroes alike.  

Vek Labs in association with RECESS & Rhetorical Music.
