### Voiceover Work:

Either in-house or sourcing other vocal talents for your commercial, we focus on capturing the correct tone and pronunciation for your video project. It is amazing what can happen when the right voice speaks for your brand!

Our techniques and talent are at your disposal to help bring a new voice to your video. We have a keen ear for voiceovers and will make sure that you are satisfied with the voice of your brand.

### Sound and Music:

Our team and partners can provide either commercial-use music and soundscapes or custom scores from award-winning musicians. Music and sound is perhaps the biggest attribute to emotional impact within any video. Our team is not satisfied until we really 'feel' the production.

This emotional impact will be felt throughout your viewers and draw them in just as much as the video itself. Humans are auditory creatures that rely on audio cues to tell them information at all times. Utilize this sense to help drive emotion and engagement with your audience.

### Colour Grading:

Using either Adobe or Davinci Resolve software; our team is skilled in colour grading for social media or other distribution avenues. Cool tones, or warm sunshine visuals— colouring frames are so important for the overall look and feel of your video.

Colour grading is another key factor to increasing emotional engagement within your viewer. Remember, the number one thing creative teams like ours strive to do is create an emotional impact within whoever watches our videos. By utilizing colour grading techniques, you set the tone for the rest of your video and create an immediate impact within the viewer’s mind.

### Motion Graphics:

Overlay elements for commercials, ads, or longer video productions provide more visual communication for your audience. Logo elements, icons, transitions, and other effects can take your production to another level. These are often some of the most compelling and exciting components of your video besides the actual footage involved. Don't let your video lack the necessary animations needed to make your elements pop and drive engagement throughout the video.

Motion graphics create an entirely new tone for your video and can be used to do nearly anything within the video. Vek Labs utilizes motion graphics elements to create strong videos that look like they belong in the Hollywood big-leagues. Transforming your footage one graphical element at a time!

### Typography:

Our editorial team comes from a graphic design background. Selection of the perfect typefaces for your brand or video campaign is crucial. In a subtle way, it provides clarity to your brand. An important part when polishing a production.

## VEK Guarantee:

When specified, we deliver a RAW video render of all usable content to you within 24 hours of filming at no additional cost.
