Before filming or editing any project, the most important considerations will always materialize during the planning phase. Vek Labs stands by a focused pre-production process that ensures all crucial conversations and pain points have been addressed before hitting 'record'.

For companies and people not in the film industry, the entire process can be a daunting and difficult experience. When looking at your budget, it's important to consider hiring a professional video production team from pre-production to post-production. This will give your campaign its best shot at succeeding on whatever platform you decide on releasing it on— whether that be YouTube, TV, or social media.

Vek Labs video producers are talented in creating engaging scripts that will bring your vision to life and keep the user locked in throughout the entire video. You need to impress your viewers within the first 10-15 seconds of your video if you want to keep them there. Your opening shot needs to be impactful and drive emotion within the viewer. We will create a compelling story that keeps the user locked in throughout the duration of your video, and leave them looking to for more from buying a product/service, to visiting your website or tuning in to your video.

We manage your content creation by addressing the following areas:

## The Planning Phase

### Project Vision:

What is the scope and purpose of your production project? What are the milestones that your team wants to hit during the lifecycle of your content? At a high-level, our team intuits your vision and looks for any pain points that need to be addressed. Our team desires to be a humble and collaborative partner for your business. Once your vision has been realized, we move into more specific areas of planning your production.

### Mood and Story:

Creative projects can be very subjective but they do not have to be unclear. During the pre-production process, we meet with your team to brainstorm. Establishing a clear vision around the mood of your production. What is the tone? Considerations we look at are: Emotive elements important for your brand, colour pallets, lighting aesthetics, and thematic refinement. Coherent story flow allows us to plan the necessary interview questions and acted scenes that will make your project successful.

The architectural design of your cinematic video begins with the core values of the theme and story you are trying to bring to your viewer's attention. We will storyboard your content using your script's outline to make sure every scene is geared towards your theme and brand image. We will tell you everything that you need to know about each and every scene so that we give your brand, product, or business the best shot it has after everything is completed.

By utilizing a company such as Vek Labs for the pre-production process, you will make sure that everyone is on the same page before the production process begins. This will save you time and money that could be wasted on poor planning and resources that could have been allocated elsewhere.
