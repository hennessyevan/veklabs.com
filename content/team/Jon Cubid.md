Video, design and the creative arts has been a passion of Jon’s since he was a child. He loves to create projects that are both exciting and gripping. Jon has experience as a videographer, editor, and graphic designer working on a wide array of videos ranging from hip-hop music videos, corporate branding videos, and longer feature-length projects. When he’s not putting an edit together, Jon can be found playing guitar & getting inspired for edits on Netflix.
